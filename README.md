# Real-Time Object Tracking using OpenCV

This project implements a real-time object tracking system using OpenCV’s CSRT tracker. The user can select any object in the first frame, and the system tracks it across subsequent frames with bounding box visualization and FPS display.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object tracking using webcam or video input
- User-selected object tracking (ROI selection)
- FPS counter for performance monitoring
- Option to reselect object during tracking

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## 🛠 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-contrib-python

2. Select the object using mouse, then press ENTER or SPACE.

3. Press r to reselect object, q to quit.

📌 Use Case

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of computer vision, including ROI selection, correlation-based tracking, and real-time video processing, making it suitable for applications in surveillance, robotics, and human-computer interaction.
